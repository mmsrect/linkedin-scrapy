Cause: 
Recently, the quality of Serie A is growing. However, there are few Chinese media focusing on Italian football. On the other hand, thanks to the Golden Era of Serie A, the ‘calcio’ fan base in Hong Kong is always strong and the fans were longing for a high-quality platform for them to express their love of Italian football. Therefore, we decided to create ’意甲大本營 Il Campo di Serie A’, an online platform aims to establish an ‘Italian football’ community in Hong Kong. 

Rebranding from 意甲路邊社 HK Serie A WFC
Previously, we were under the name ‘意甲路邊社 HK Serie A WFC’. However, since the support and enthusiasm in Hong Kong are growing rapidly, the nature of Serie A WFC, a media page, is not enough for the community in Hong Kong.Therefore, we decided to rebrand our media platform and provide more diverse contents to our audience. Thanks to the effort from our team and the support of local media, we have established networks among Hong Kong, Macau, England and Italy. 

Our aims:
‘Campo’ in English means ‘field’ or ‘camp’. At the beginning of Italian football, before the appearance of ‘stadio/stadium’, ‘campo’ is a public space where football was played while different people met up to share their interest and passion. We hope to continue this tradition and create an open space for fans to communicate. 
We want to present not merely football, but also the history & culture behind Italy. Since the Italian football fans in Hong Kong admire Italy greatly, we hope that we could establish a friendship between Italy and Hong Kong. Meanwhile, we also hope to promote the Italian community in Hong Kong to our Chinese audience.

AFC Wimbledon is a continuation of the former Wimbledon Football Club, which no longer exists after the franchising of its league place to Milton Keynes. The club was formed by fans who refused to follow the Midlands based club and decided to form their own. Since its re-birth in 2002 AFC Wimbledon has been promoted six times and won three league championships, three promotion play-off finals and two cups.

AFC Wimbledon is owned by the fans through a mutual member industrial and provident society known as 'The Dons Trust'​. Control is exercised by the Dons Trust through its majority ownership of shares in AFCW PLC. 

AFCW PLC is a limited company formed in 2003 to raise funds to purchase Kingsmeadow Stadium where the club was based from 2002-2019.
